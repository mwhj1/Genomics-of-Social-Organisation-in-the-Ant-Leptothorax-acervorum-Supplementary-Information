I have converted the VCFs of these scaffold sets to phylip alignment format separately for male and female samples, for 6 alignments (3 each for males and females). 

I then used PhyML to create trees with the following options:
-100 bootstraps
-GTR substitution model
-Maximum likelihood estimation of base character frequencies
-Maximum likelihood estimation of transition/transversion ratio
-Maximum likelihood estimation of the proportion of invariable sites
-Maximum likelihood estimation of gamma distribution shape parameter
-FreeRate model of substution rate across sites
-Best of NNI and SPR for tree topology searching
-Tree topology, branch length and rate parameters all optimised

I did not do model selection, after reading this paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08822-w#Sec9).  It suggests that using the most parameter-rich model is usually fine, and they recommend GTR+I+G.  I could not work out how to do the +I+G but chose GTR as, from the PhyML manual, this is the most parameter-rich model available (all the other substitution models constrain the GTR model somehow).  The rest of the options were chosen to make the tree inference as sensitive as possible.
